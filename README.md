# stock-analysis
###Overview of Project

##Purpose
#### We were tasked with assisting Steve in determining what stocks were worth recommending to his parents as investment options. In this project we edited, or refactored, code to loop through data. We compared the length of time it took to run the initial code versus the refactored code, confirming that refactoring code not only makes it run more efficiently but also more quickly. By taking few steps and using less memory, we make the code easier for us to use as well as future users.

## Results
#### We were introduced to VBA with a step by step tutorial of the structure of the code that outlined how to construct an input box, initialize formatting, designate ticker arrays, and how to activate the appropriate worksheets. I've attached my final code below:
## Summary
#### Refactoring definitely consolidates and makes code run faster and smoother. It's convenient to see everything in one window and makes the code easier to read and debug if need be.
#### Although my macro returned results fasterm as an inexperienced coder, dispersing the code and designating different modules for different functions is more simple. Concatenating and ensuring code follows syntax is one of the issues I encountered during the module.
## Advantage of Refactoring
