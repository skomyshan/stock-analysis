# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project
###### We were tasked with assisting Steve in determining what stocks were worth recommending to his parents as investment options. After completing the module in a similar format, we refactored the code to increase the overall efficiency and speed of results.
## Results
###### We were introduced to VBA with a step by step tutorial of the structure of the code that outlined how to construct an input box, initialize formatting, designate ticker arrays, and how to activate the appropriate worksheets. I've attached my final code below:
###### Sub AllStocksAnalysisRefactored()
    Dim startTime As Single
    Dim endTime  As Single

    yearValue = InputBox("What year would you like to run the analysis on?")

    startTime = Timer
    
    'Format the output sheet on All Stocks Analysis worksheet
    Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
    
    Range("A1").Value = "All Stocks (" + yearValue + ")"
    
    'Create a header row
    Cells(3, 1).Value = "Ticker"
    Cells(3, 2).Value = "Total Daily Volume"
    Cells(3, 3).Value = "Return"

    'Initialize array of all tickers
    Dim tickers(12) As String
    
    tickers(0) = "AY"
    tickers(1) = "CSIQ"
    tickers(2) = "DQ"
    tickers(3) = "ENPH"
    tickers(4) = "FSLR"
    tickers(5) = "HASI"
    tickers(6) = "JKS"
    tickers(7) = "RUN"
    tickers(8) = "SEDG"
    tickers(9) = "SPWR"
    tickers(10) = "TERP"
    tickers(11) = "VSLR"
    
    'Activate data worksheet
    Worksheets(yearValue).Activate
    
    'Get the number of rows to loop over
    RowCount = Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    '1a) Create a ticker Index
    tickerIndex = 0

    '1b) Create three output arrays
    Dim tickerVolumes(12) As Single
    Dim tickerStartingPrices(12) As Single
    Dim tickerEndingPrices(12) As Single
    
    ''2a) Create a for loop to initialize the tickerVolumes to zero.
    For i = 0 To 11
    tickerVolumes(i) = 0
    
    Next i
        
    ''2b) Loop over all the rows in the spreadsheet.
    For i = 2 To RowCount
    
        '3a) Increase volume for current ticker
        tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) = tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) + Cells(i, 8).Value
        
        '3b) Check if the current row is the first row with the selected tickerIndex.
        'If  Then
        If Cells(i - 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
            tickerStartingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
            
        End If
            
            
        'End If
        
        '3c) check if the current row is the last row with the selected ticker
         'If the next row’s ticker doesn’t match, increase the tickerIndex.
        'If  Then
            
            If Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
                tickerEndingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value

            '3d Increase the tickerIndex.
            tickerIndex = tickerIndex + 1
        End If
            
        'End If
    
    Next i
    
    '4) Loop through your arrays to output the Ticker, Total Daily Volume, and Return.
    For i = 0 To 11
        
        Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
        
        Cells(4 + i, 1).Value = tickers(i)
        Cells(4 + i, 2).Value = tickerVolumes(i)
        Cells(4 + i, 3).Value = tickerEndingPrices(i) / tickerStartingPrices(i) - 1
        
        
    Next i
    
    'Formatting
    Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
    Range("A3:C3").Font.FontStyle = "Bold"
    Range("A3:C3").Borders(xlEdgeBottom).LineStyle = xlContinuous
    Range("B4:B15").NumberFormat = "#,##0"
    Range("C4:C15").NumberFormat = "0.0%"
    Columns("B").AutoFit

    dataRowStart = 4
    dataRowEnd = 15

    For i = dataRowStart To dataRowEnd
        
        If Cells(i, 3) > 0 Then
            
            Cells(i, 3).Interior.Color = vbGreen
            
        Else
        
            Cells(i, 3).Interior.Color = vbRed
            
        End If
        
    Next i
 
    endTime = Timer
    MsgBox "This code ran in " & (endTime - startTime) & " seconds for the year " & (yearValue)

End Sub
## Summary
###### Refactoring definitely consolidates and makes code run faster and smoother. It's convenient to see everything in one window and makes the code easier to read and debug if need be.
###### Although my macro returned results fasterm as an inexperienced coder, dispersing the code and designating different modules for different functions is more simple. Concatenating and ensuring code follows syntax is one of the issues I encountered during the module.
## Advantage of Refactoring
###### I was able to get results in as little as 0.2460938 seconds for the year of 2017 and in 0.1992188 seconds for 2018.
