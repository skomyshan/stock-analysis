## Overview of Project: Stock Analysis with VBA and Excel
#### We were tasked with assisting Steve in determining what stocks were worth recommending to his parents as investment options. In this project we edited, or refactored, code to loop through data. We compared the length of time it took to run the initial code versus the refactored code, confirming that refactoring code not only makes it run more efficiently but also more quickly. By taking few steps and using less memory, we make the code easier for us to use as well as future users.

## Summary

### Stock analysis outputs for 2017 and 2018 are the same as the dataset example provided. In the resources folder are the message-boxes showing elapsed run time for the refactored code. 

**Disadvantages:**

> - Refactoring may affect the testing outcomes.
> - Logical structures may be duplicated in two or more lines of code.
> - Ideally, complex code should be split in several functions.

**Advantages:**

> - Allows us to more easily detect logical errors.
> - For the purposes of this project, the code is not tied to the order in which it is written.
> - The code is easier to maintain, easy to change, and easy to understand.
